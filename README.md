# Skyler Lin 
===

This project pushed me to understand data visualization tools in the data visualization commmunity better. The 5 tools that aI chose each had some learning curve to them, in the end it was worth it because I learned alot about which ones I preferred and didn't prefer going forward. 

## Altair

Altair was one of the easier tools to get started with because it uses a lot of declarative syntax that closely matches how charts can be described in a concetual way. Mapping the values for the x-axis, y-axis, colors, and size was very straightforward. Adjusting axis domains and the tick values was very intuitive. One challenge was trying to understand that size encoding in Altair represents area rather than radius for those values, which required adjusting the scale range to make size differences clear, I could see how Altair can ve useful when rapid prototyping and maybe in more Python heavy workflows. 

## d3

D3 was the most flexible and standard tool I worked with out of all 5. However I found it kind of hard. Everything from trying to load the CSV file to defining the scales and margins had to be done completely manual. While this made the process more time-consuming, it also gave me complete control over the layout and styling of the visualization. Creating custom legends for both species and bill length also required additional logic and careful positioning outside of the intended plot area. However, I believe that D3 would be the most useful visualization tool if you wanted to customize interative visualizations where more control is needed. 

## ggPlot2

Using ggPlot 2 in R was really straightforward as it was very structuredand consistent thanks to the grammar and graphics. Once I loaded the data, creating the scatter plot with color and size mappings was concise and very readable. Adjusting the labels and scales was easy to accomplish though with some tuning I was able to get the axis limits and legend formatting better. ggplot2 seemed well suited for statistical contexts. 

## PowerBI

Power BI required little to no code, which made it quick to create a basic version of the visualization. Drag and drop encodings made it easy to assign axes, color, and size. However, achieving precise control over axis ticks and size scaling was more difficult compared to code based tools. Power BI feels best suited for business dashboards where interactivity and integration with data sources matter more than low-level customization.

## VegaLite

VegaLite offered a strong balance between control and simplicity. Like Altair, it is declarative, but working directly with the JSON specification made the underlying visualization model more explicit. Setting chart dimensions, axis ticks, legends, and size scaling was straightforward once the schema was understood. Vega-Lite would be particularly useful for web-based visualizations and for sharing standardized, reproducible chart specifications.


## Technical Achievements
To go beyond the basic requirements of the assignment, I focused on implementing more structural decisions across the languages. In D3, I manually created both a species color legend and a bill length size legend positioned outside of the plotting area. This required defining explicit scales and constructing custom SVG elements. I also customized axis domains and tick values so that the scales did not start at zero, which more accurately reflected the data and better matched the reference visualization.

In Altair and VegaLite, I explored declarative approaches to visualization by explicitly coding in position, color, size, and opacity through the specification. I adjusted the size scale so that bill length mapped to point size making sure that larger bill lengths produced larger points. I also controlled chart dimensions, axis ticks, and data loading methods to make the visualizations reproducible and consistent. These technical choices demonstrate an understanding of how different visualization systems.

### Design Achievements
From a design perspective, I readability across all five visualizations. I used different color mapping for penguin species so that the species appeared in different colors across different tools, making comparisons easier when viewing multiple charts. Point sizes were tuned to reflect bill length without overpowering the plot, and semi-transparent points were used to reduce visual clutter and help overlapping points remain visible.

I also paid attention to layout and hierarchy. Legends were placed outside the plotting area to avoid covering data points, axes were clearly labeled with units, and chart dimensions were increased to improve overall readability. Where possible, I relied on clean, minimal design choices to keep the focus on the data rather than decoration.
